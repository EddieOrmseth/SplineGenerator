My name is Eddie Ormseth.

These are a collection of jars that I have prepared for those who would like to play with my code.

Java must be installed to run them (I created them with OpenJDK 11).

If double clicking them does note work navigate to the folder in a terminal and try the commmand "javaw.exe -jar <name of jar>"

The arrow keys can be used to control the ball.
The ball will stop moving while the shift key is held.
Pressing space will reset the ball.
